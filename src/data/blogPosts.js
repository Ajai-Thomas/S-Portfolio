      title: "The Art of Capturing Light",
      date: "October 15, 2025",
      author: "Agnieszka Trefler",
      excerpt: "Exploring the fundamental role of light in photography and how to manipulate it to create mood and drama...",
      content: `Light is the raw material of photography. Without it, there is no image. But more than that, the quality, direction, and color of light are what give a photograph its mood, texture, and depth.\n\nUnderstanding how to see and shape light is arguably the most crucial skill a photographer can develop. Whether it's the soft, diffused light of an overcast day perfect for portraits, or the harsh, dramatic shadows of a midday sun for architectural shots, every type of light tells a different story.`

      author: "Agnieszka Trefler",
      excerpt: "In a world saturated with color, the timeless appeal of monochrome imagery continues to captivate photographers and viewers alike...",
      content: `Removing color from an image forces the viewer to see the world differently. Without the distraction of hues, we are left with the core elements of a photograph: light, shadow, texture, and composition. This is the power of black and white.\n\nIt can feel more emotional, more timeless, and more dramatic. It strips away reality to reveal a deeper truth.
